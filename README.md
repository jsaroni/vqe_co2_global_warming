# vqe_co2_global_warming_active_space

Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) can be leveraged in direct air capture of carbon dioxide by calculating the potential energy surface of atmospheric gas molecules (CO2, H2O, N2) in the vicinity of the MOFsâ€™ preferential binding sites.
In this project I assemble a vqe code that calculates the ground state energy of a MgCO2 MOF. More information about the project and the code is within the PDF 2023_QuantumClimateChallenge_DetailedDescription.pdf and the Jupyter notebook vqe_active_space.ipynb.
