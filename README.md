# vqe_co2_global_warming_active_space

Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) can be leveraged in direct air capture of carbon dioxide by calculating the potential energy surface of atmospheric gas molecules (CO2, H2O, N2) in the vicinity of the MOFsâ€™ preferential binding sites.
In this project I assemble a vqe code that calculates the ground state energy of a MgCO2 MOF. More information is within the vqe_active_space.ipynb Jupyter notebook code.
